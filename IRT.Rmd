The Law School Admission Test (LSAT),
The LSAT is a classical example in educational testing for measuring ability traits. This test was designed to measure a single latent ability scale.

*Format*  

A data frame with the responses of 1000 individuals to 5 questions.

```

## Model

Logistic distribution:

```{r,}
IRTmodel <- ltm(LSAT~z1,IRT.param= TRUE)

```

## Results

```{r,}
IRTmodel <- ltm(LSAT~z1,IRT.param= TRUE)
summary(IRTmodel)
coef(IRTmodel)
``` 
 
The Difficulty is analagous to $\theta$ and 'ability'.
The figures are $<0$ and in this respect the questions are 'easy'.

Discrimination describes how well the question discriminates ability; in this context a good discriminator would be $>1$; these questions are poor discriminators.    
  
## Plots 
```{r,}
plot(IRTmodel, type="ICC")

```

S curves would be optimal but the tails are missing.   
  
  
  
  
```{r}
plot(IRTmodel, type ="ICC",items=3)
```
  
Curve 3 is the most representative of an S curve and this item is the best discrimator of ability.    
  
    
```{r}
plot(IRTmodel, type ="IIC",items=0)      
```     
 
   
```{r}    
factor.scores(IRTmodel)
```
  
  
Empirical Bayes scoring  

Where z1 is the predicted ability based on the pattern of scores.
Most common combination is to get them all right (298), questions are too easy.  
  
  
#3PL 

```{r}
IRTmodel_guess=tpm(LSAT,type="latent.trait",IRT.param = TRUE)
```  
  
    
    
  
```{r}
factor.scores(IRTmodel_guess)
```  

```{r}
anova(IRTmodel,IRTmodel_guess)  

```
  
Addition of guessing parameter does not improve the model,illustrated by log likelihood.  
There is no significant variance between 2PL and 3PL.
